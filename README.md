# Frontend Blog Application

This project is a simple yet fully functional blog site built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Users can read posts, and administrators can add, edit, and delete posts.

## Features

- View a list of posts on the homepage
- Read individual post details on separate pages
- Admin capabilities to create, update, and delete posts

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. The backend API should also be set up for the frontend to fetch data. The backend should be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/frontend-blog-app-node.git
   cd frontend-blog-app-node
   ```

2. Install NPM packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Runs the app in development mode.\
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

   The page will reload when you make changes.\
   You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Scripts

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### Deployment

To deploy this project, you can follow the guidelines provided in the [Create React App documentation on deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment). This application is prepared to be deployed using services like Heroku or Vercel for frontend hosting.

#### Deploying to Heroku

For backend deployment, see [Deploying Node.js to Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-nodejs).

#### Deploying to Vercel

For frontend deployment, refer to [Vercel Documentation](https://vercel.com/docs).

## Configuring the Backend API

Ensure your backend API is accessible from the URL set in your frontend's environment variables. Update the `.env` file or directly modify the API endpoints in your service files.
